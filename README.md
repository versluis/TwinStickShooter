# Twin Stick Shooter 

Unreal Engine 4 demo following the legendary UE4 course by Zak Parrish, which has so sadly been removed from public access. I've built this project myself back in the day, but alas my project did not survivie a hard drive cleanup recently.

I was thrilled to find a copy by [Dalton](https://github.com/daltonbr/TwinStickShooter) and forked it from there. I'd like to re-create this project in UE5, for which this will be a great template. 

Both of these links are now defunct, but perhaps they'll come back to life in the future:
